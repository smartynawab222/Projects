//Collection Frame work--->Classes/Interfaces/Functions-->Some Data Structure has already been created-->it is actually use to implement Data Structure
//So that we do not need to create any Data Structure from Scratch


//==>School Admission--> Students + Parents===> First Come First Serve Admission Process-->So we need to Arrange the Admission Process Data in Special Way
//--->plus we need to Store Students + Parents Data===> and both the Data must be Club together
//therefore different types of data needs to be store in different way==> so here comes Data Structure in picture
//==> Data Structure Provides us So many tools==> to make our coding easier
//==> Collection Frame Work
//==> Collection of Classes And Interfaces--->Iterable---->it is Implement by (Collection Interface)---> and this Consist three most important Interfaces
//==>List
//Queue
//Set
//Above all three Interfaces comes under the Collection Interface
//Above all three can be said as Data Structure
//How to use All Data Structure Because all data structures Are interfaces, and they can not be use directly
//they all can be used in the forms of Classes


//Methods of Collections/Data Structure--> Methods use to implement All kind of Interfaces
//Add Method-->we can add any information in the Object of any class
//Size-->Size of an Object/Collection/Data Structure
//Remove--> Use to remove any object
//Iterate--> used for loop implementation
//Add All ---> when we want to add too many objects inside the Data Structure
//Remove all-->when we want to remove too many objects inside the Data Structure
//Clear--> used to completely clear our Data Structure at once

//For all the Methods we can take the examples of Array List


//Interfaces
//1)-->List Interface(Easy to implement)==> ArrayList(Variable size Data Structure),==>LinkedList(It is used to combine different parts/objects together),==>Vector(almost same to Linked list), (it is Thread safe)
//==>Stack Data structure(Heap and Stack)

//2)---> Queue Interface(Special property-->FIFO==>First In First Out)==>PriorityQueue(Token according priority),(Example of School Student),==> LinkedList(In FIFO Style)==>Deque(Double Ended Queue means data can be added from both sides of queue(Generally it has been added from back side))
//Deque-->ArrayDeque class object
//Sets is a group of objects in which all objects are unique
//3)-->Set Interfaces/(Map Interfaces)==>Most Important Interfaces of java but does not come under Data Structure==>HashSet(Normal Element sets),==>LinkedHashSet(in which one element is connected with other on the First Come, First Served Basis),==> TreeSet(it is also called sorted SET)
//4)-->Map Interfaces==>(Map two things <--> Key AND Values(Example :- Student(Key) with Parents(Values), Car's Number Plate(Key) with Owner(Values)
//Classes of Map Interface==>HashMap(uses set for Implementation)(Normal (Key/Value) pairs sets),===>LinkedHashMap(in which one (Key/Value) pairs is connected with other on the First Come, First Served Basis),==>TreeMap(Sorted Key/Values),==>Hashtable do not use frequently
